# hello-world
ABOUT MEEEEEE:
Hello. My name is TooMuchSlime.
I... Do stuff? 
I like Mac & Cheese. Which is weird, because I don't really like cheese. I am weird, I guess. 
I wanted to start coding HTML, but I already did that so I thought Git would be better. I hope it is!
  P.S. this is the hello-world project from GitHub Guides' tutorial on hello-world project.
